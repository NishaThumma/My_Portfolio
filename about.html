            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a 2023 graduate in Computer Science Engineering from Vivekananda Institute of Technology and Science, with a passion for technology and data science. Throughout my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS.</p>
            <p>I have completed various internships and projects that have equipped me with the skills needed to tackle real-world challenges. My recent projects include a COVID-19 updated cases dashboard, an encrypted data management system, and a coverless information hiding method. Each project has helped me refine my technical skills and provided insight into the importance of data security and analysis.</p>
            <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am an avid photographer and enjoy traveling to explore new cultures. I believe that these experiences enhance my creativity and problem-solving abilities.</p>
